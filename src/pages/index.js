          <h3>Hey!</h3>
          <p>
            I'm Alex! I'm a junior web developer from Ogden, UT. After receiving
            my Associates at Weber State University, I jumped right into web
            development at Devmountain, taking the Web Development course, which
            I completed in May of 2022. When I'm not working, I enjoy spending
            my down time with familyâ€“camping, hiking, traveling, and watching
            sports. And of course, finding time to code something new. Check out
            my <Link to="/resume">resume!</Link>
